[@transitingnow](https://twitter.com/transitingnow) Source Code
=============

A TwitterBot project that retrieves the exoplanet database from [exoplanets.org](http://www.exoplanets.org/), and posts to Twitter when transiting planets are in mid-transit. Follow [@transitingnow](https://twitter.com/transitingnow) to see it in action!

### Contents
* updateEventList.py - Builds a Python dictionary of upcoming mid-transit times, where the "key" is the UTC minute in ISO format, and the "value" is a list of tweets to be posted in that minute. This script runs every 24 hours via [cron](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron).
* postEvents.py - Reads the tweet dictionary generated by updateEventsList.py, does a quick look-up for tweets in the current minute, and posts them to Twitter via [Tweepy](https://github.com/tweepy/tweepy). This script runs every minute via cron.
* shownextevents.py - Uses the same look-up procedure as postEvents.py to find all events that will be posted in the next N minutes. To be run via the command line for checking/debugging.

### Dependencies
* [Tweepy](https://github.com/tweepy/tweepy) for posting to Twitter
* [Numpy](http://www.scipy.org/) for pseudorandom number generation
* [Astropy](http://www.astropy.org/) for converting between Julian and Gregorian dates
* [PyEphem](http://rhodesmill.org/pyephem/) for identifying the constellations of planet-hosting stars
